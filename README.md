# Book-Writers
The repository "Book-Writers" contains all the information related to "https://kathanilayam.com/". Using the data from the website we automatically created the writers wiki pages.
Data files: 
1) books_data_final : list of books for each writer/author
2) stories_data_final : list of stories for each writer/author
3) writers_data_final : personal data about writer

Data is read from all the three files inorder to write a template about each writer. 

male_template_v3 : jinja template for the wiki article

The xml file is large and unable to upload the file. If anyone wants the file they can download it from the below link:
[writers_articles.xml](https://iiitaphyd-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/mounika_marreddy_research_iiit_ac_in/Ec0gkgJM3_5Nt6REltRFmdkBGipr0ZBZa0irpvb20ksoJA?e=9KX8AW) 

new_writers_render_v2.py file is used to merge the three datafiles and generate the xml file.
